    "The problems consiste in determining the temperature variation along a\n",

    "$$\\nabla \\cdot Q = -\\frac{dE}{dt}.$$ The variation of the internal\n",

    "temperature: $$\\frac{dE}{dt} = \\rho c \\frac{dT}{dt},$$ where $\\rho$ is\n",
    "the density, and $c$ is the specific heat of the material. Fourier’s Law\n",
