    "=============================\n",
    "\n",
    "Kepler’s problem\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The motion of the sun and the earth is an example of a “two-body\n",
    "problem”. This is a relatively simple problem that can be solved\n",
    "analytically (it interesting to notice here, however, that adding a new\n",
    "object to the problem, the moon for instance, make it completely\n",
    "intractable. This is the famous “three body problem”). We can assume\n",
    "that, to a good approximation, the sun is stationary and is a convenient\n",
    "origin of our coordinate system. This is equivalent to changing to a\n",
    "“center of mass” coordinate system, where most of the mass is\n",
    "concentrated in the sun. The problem can be reduced to an equivalent one\n",
    "body problem involving an object of reduced mass $\\mu$ given by\n",
    "$$\\mu=\\frac{mM}{m+M}$$ Since the mass of the earth is\n",
    "$m=5.99\\times 10^{24}$ kg and the mass of the sun is\n",
    "$M=1.99\\times 10^{30}$ kg we find that for most practical purposes, the\n",
    "reduced mass of the earth-sun system is that of the earth. Hence, in the\n",
    "following we are going to consider the problem of a single particle of\n",
    "mass $m$ moving about a fixed center of force, which we take as the\n",
    "origin of the coordinate system. The gravitational force on the particle\n",
    "m is given by $${\\mathbf F}=-\\frac{GMm}{r^3}{\\mathbf r},$$ where the\n",
    "vector ${\\mathbf r}$ is directed from $M$ to $m$, and $G$ is the\n",
    "gravitation constant $$G=6.67\\times 10^{-11} \\frac{m^3}{kg.s^2}$$ The\n",
    "negative sign implies that the gravitational force is attractive, and\n",
    "decreases with the separation $r$. The gravitational force is a “central\n",
    "force”: its magnitude depends on the separation between the particles\n",
    "and its direction is along the line that connects them. The assumption\n",
    "is that the motion is confined to the $xy$ plane. The angular momentum\n",
    "${\\mathbf L}$ lies on the third direction $z$ and is a constant of\n",
    "motion, <span>*i.e.*</span> it is conserved:\n",
    "$$L_z=({\\mathbf r}\\times m{\\mathbf v})_z=m(xv_y-yv_x)=\\mathrm{const.}$$\n",
    "An additional constant of motion ins the total energy $E$ given by\n",
    "$$E=\\frac{1}{2}mv^2-\\frac{GmM}{r}$$ If we fix the coordinate system in\n",
    "the sun, the equation of motion is\n",
    "$$m\\frac{d^2{\\mathbf r}}{dt^2}=-\\frac{mMG}{r^3}{\\mathbf r}$$ For\n",
    "computational purposes it is convenient to write it down in cartesian\n",
    "components: $$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "&& F_x=-\\frac{GMm}{r^2}\\cos{\\theta}=-\\frac{GMm}{r^3}x, \\\\\n",
    "&& F_y=-\\frac{GMm}{r^2}\\sin{\\theta}=-\\frac{GMm}{r^3}y.\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "Hence, the equations of motions in cartesian coordinates are:\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "&& \\frac{d^2x}{dt}=-\\frac{GM}{r^3}x, \\\\\n",
    "&& \\frac{d^2y}{dt}=-\\frac{GM}{r^3}y, \\end{aligned}$$ where\n",
    "$r^2=x^2+y^2$. These are coupled differential equations, since each\n",
    "differential equation contains both $x$ and $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Circular motion \n",
    "\n",
    "Since many planetary orbits are nearly circular, it is useful to obtain\n",
    "the condition for a circular orbit. In this case, the magnitude of the\n",
    "acceleration ${\\mathbf a}$ is related to the radius by\n",
    "$$a=\\frac{v^2}{r}$$ where $v$ is the speed of the object. The\n",
    "acceleration is always directed toward the center. Hence\n",
    "$$\\frac{mv^2}{r}=\\frac{mMG}{r^2}$$ or $$v=(\\frac{MG}{r})^{1/2}.\n",
    "$$ This is a general condition for the circular orbit.\n",
    "We can also find the dependence of the period $T$ on the radius of a\n",
    "circular orbit. Using the relation $$T=\\frac{2\\pi r}{v},$$ we obtain\n",
    "$$T^2=\\frac{4\\pi^2r^3}{GM}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Elliptical orbits \n",
    "\n",
    "An ellipse has two foci $F_1$ and $F_2$, and has the property that for\n",
    "any point the distance $F_1P+F_2P$ is a constant. It also has a\n",
    "horizontal semi-axis $a$ and a vertical $b$. It is common in astronomy\n",
    "to characterize an orbit by its “eccentricity” $e$, given by the ratio\n",
    "of the distance between the foci, and the length of the major axis $2a$.\n",
    "Since $F_1P+F_2P=2a$, it is easy to show that (consider a point $P$ at\n",
    "$x=0$,$y=b$) $$e=\\sqrt{1-\\frac{b^2}{a^2}},$$ with $0<e<1$. A special\n",
    "case is $a=b$ for which the ellipse reduces to a circle and $e=0$. The\n",
    "earth orbit has eccentricity $e=0.0167$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Astronomical units \n",
    "It is useful to choose a system of units where the product $GM$ is of\n",
    "the order of unity. To describe the earth’s motion, the convention is to\n",
    "choose the earth’s semi-major axis as the unit of length, called\n",
    "“astronomical unit” (AU) and is $$1AU=1.496 \\times 10^{11}m.$$ The unit\n",
    "of time is taken to be “one year”, or $3.15 \\times 10^7$s. In these\n",
    "units, $T=1$yr, $a=1AU$, and we can write\n",
    "$$GM=\\frac{4\\pi ^2a^3}{T^2}=4\\pi ^2 AU^3/yr^2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 2.1: Simulation of the orbit \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Write a program to simulate motion in a central force field. Verify\n",
    "    the case of circular orbit using (in astronomical units) ($x_0=1$,\n",
    "    $y_0=0$ and $v_x(t=0)=0$. Use the condition (\\[circular\\] to\n",
    "    calculate $v_y(t=0)$ for a circular orbit. Choose a value of\n",
    "    $\\Delta \n",
    "    t$ such that to a good approximation the total energy $E$\n",
    "    is conserved. Is your value of $\\Delta t$ small enough to reproduce\n",
    "    the orbit over several periods?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Run the program for different sets of initial conditions $x_0$ and\n",
    "    $v_y(t=0)$ consistent with the condition for a circular orbit. Set\n",
    "    $y_0=0$ and $v_x(t=0)=0$. For each orbit, measure the radius and the\n",
    "    period to verify Kepler’s third law ($T^2/a^3=\\mathrm{const.}$).\n",
    "    Think of a simple condition which allows you to find the numerical\n",
    "    value of the period.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Show that Euler’s method does not shield stable orbits for the same\n",
    "    choice of $\\Delta t$ used in the previous items. Is it sufficient to\n",
    "    simply choose a smaller $\\Delta t$ or Euler’s method is no stable\n",
    "    for this dynamical system? Use the average velocity\n",
    "    $1/2(v_n+v_{n+1})$ to obtain $x_{n+1}$. Are the results any better?\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Set $y_0=0$ and $v_x(t=0)=0$. By trial and error find several\n",
    "    choices of $x_0$ and $v_y(t=0)$ which yield coonvinient\n",
    "    elliptical orbits. Determine total energy, angular momentum,\n",
    "    semi-major and semi-nimor axes, eccentricity, and period for\n",
    "    each orbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  You probably noticed that Euler’s algorithm with a fixed $\\Delta t$\n",
    "    breaks down if you get to close to the sun. How are you able to\n",
    "    visually confirm this? What is the cause of the failure of the\n",
    "    method? Think of a simple modification of your program that can\n",
    "    improve your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "A mini solar system\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The presence of other planets implies that the total force on a planet\n",
    "is no longer a central force. Furthermore, since the orbits are not\n",
    "exactly on the same plane, the analysis must be extended to 3D. However,\n",
    "for simplicity, we are going to consider a two-dimensional solar system,\n",
    "with two planets in orbit around the sun.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equations of motion of the two planets of mass $m_1$ and $m_2$ can\n",
    "be written in vector form as $$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "&& m_1\\frac{d^2 {\\mathbf r}_1}{dt^2}=-\\frac{m_1MG}{r_1^3}{\\mathbf \n",
    "r}_1+\\frac{m_1m_2G}{r_{21}^3}{\\mathbf r}_{21}, \\\\\n",
    "&& m_2\\frac{d^2 {\\mathbf r}_2}{dt^2}=-\\frac{m_2MG}{r_2^3}{\\mathbf \n",
    "r}_2+\\frac{m_1m_2G}{r_{21}^3}{\\mathbf r}_{21},\\end{aligned}$$ where\n",
    "${\\mathbf r}_1$ and ${\\mathbf r}_2$ are directed form the sun to the\n",
    "planets, and ${\\mathbf r}_{21}={\\mathbf r}_2-{\\mathbf r}_1$ is the\n",
    "vector from planet 1 to planet 2. This is a problem with no analytical\n",
    "solution, but its numerical solution can be obtained extending our\n",
    "previous analysis for the two-body problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 2.2: A three body problem \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider astronomical units, and values for the masses\n",
    "$m_1/M=0.001$ and $m_2/M=0.01$. Consider initial positions $r_1=1$ and\n",
    "$r_2=4/3$ and velocities ${\\mathbf v}_{1,2}=(0,\\sqrt{GM/r_{1,2}})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Write a program to calculate the trajectories of the two planets,\n",
    "    and plot them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  What would the shape and the periods of the orbits be if the don’t\n",
    "    interact? What is the qualitative effect of the interaction. Why is\n",
    "    one planet affected more by the interaction that the other? Are the\n",
    "    angular momentum and energy of planet 1 conserved? Is the total\n",
    "    momentum an energy of the two planets conserved?\n",
    "\n",
    "Scattering by a central potential\n",
    "---------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will investigate the classical scattering of a\n",
    "particle of mass $m$ by a central potential. In a scattering event, the\n",
    "particle, with initial kinetic energy $E$ and impact parameter $b$\n",
    "approaches the potential from a large distance. It is deflected during\n",
    "its passage near the force center and eventually emerges with the same\n",
    "energy, but moving at an angle $\\Theta$ with respect to the original\n",
    "direction. This problem is very similar in many aspects to the orbital\n",
    "motion, but in this case the potential is repulsive, and it is not\n",
    "necessarily a function of the inverse square of the distance. The energy\n",
    "and momentum are conserved, and the trajectory lies in the plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our basic interest is on the deflection function $\\Theta (b)$, giving\n",
    "the final scattering angle $\\Theta$ as a function of the impact\n",
    "parameter. This function also depends upon the incident energy. The\n",
    "differential cross section for scattering at an angle $\\Theta$,\n",
    "$d\\sigma \n",
    "/ d\\Omega$ is an experimental observable that is related to the\n",
    "deflection function by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega}=\\frac{b}{\\sin{\\Theta}}|\\frac{db}{d\\Theta}|.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, if $d\\Theta /db$ can be computed, the cross section is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions for the deflection function can be found analytically only\n",
    "for a few potentials, so that numerical methods usually must be\n",
    "employed. There are some simplification that can me made using the fact\n",
    "that the angular momentum is conserved, which connects the angular and\n",
    "the radial motion, making the problem one-dimensional. However, in this\n",
    "section we are going to use the tools learned in the previous sections,\n",
    "and solve the four first-order differential equations for the two\n",
    "coordinates and their velocities in the $xy$ plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we are going to consider a Lennard-Jones potential:\n",
    "$$V(r)=4V_0[(\\frac{a}{r})^{12}-(\\frac{a}{r})^6],\n",
    "$$ The potential is attractive for long distances, and\n",
    "strongly repulsive approaching the core (see Fig. \\[lennard-jones\\]),\n",
    "with a minimum occurring at $r_{min}=2^{(1/6)}a$ with a depth $V_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 2.3 \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Before beginning any numerical computation, it is important to have\n",
    "    some idea of what the results should look like. Sketch what you\n",
    "    think the deflection function should look like at relatively low\n",
    "    energies, $E \\leq V_0$, where the the peripheral collisions at large\n",
    "    $b\\leq \n",
    "    r_{max}$ will take place in a predominantly attractive potential and\n",
    "    the more central collisions will “bounce” against the\n",
    "    repulsive core. What happens at much higher energies $E\\gg V_0$,\n",
    "    where the attractive pocket in $V$ can be neglected? Note that the\n",
    "    values of $b$ where the deflection function has a maximum or a\n",
    "    minimum, Eq. (\\[cross\\]) shows that the cross section should be\n",
    "    infinite,as occurs in the rainbow formed when light scatters from\n",
    "    water drops.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Write a program that calculates, for a given kinetic energy $E$, the\n",
    "    deflection function solving the equations of motion a a number of\n",
    "    equally spaced $b$ values between 0 and $r_{max}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Use your program to calculate the deflection function for scattering\n",
    "    from a Lennard-Jones potential at selected values of $E$ ranging\n",
    "    from $0.1V_0$ to $100V_0$. Reconcile your answers in step 1) with\n",
    "    the results obtained. Calculate the differential cross sections a\n",
    "    function of $Theta$ at these energies.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  If your program is working correctly you should observe for energies\n",
    "    $E\\leq V_0$ a singularity in the deflection function where $\\Theta$\n",
    "    appear to approach $-\\infty$ at some critical value of $b$,\n",
    "    $b_{crit}$, that depends on $E$. This singularity, which disappears\n",
    "    when $E$ becomes larger that about $V_0$ is characteristic of\n",
    "    “orbiting”, and the scattering angle becomes\n",
    "    logarithmically infinite. What happens is that the particle spends a\n",
    "    very long time spiralling around the center. Calculate some\n",
    "    trajectories around this point and convince yourself that this is\n",
    "    precisely what’s happening. Determine the maximum energy for which\n",

    "Trajectories in phase space and integrability\n",
    "---------------------------------------------\n",

    "Let’s “complicate” things a little bit. We know that all the problems\n",
