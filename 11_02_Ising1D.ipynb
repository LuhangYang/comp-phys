    "The Ising model\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a lattice with $N$ sites, where each site $i$ can assume two\n",
    "possible states $s_i=+1,-1$, or spin “up” and spin “down”. A particular\n",
    "configuration or microstate of the lattice is specified by the set of\n",
    "variables $\\{s_1,s_2,...s_N\\}$ for all lattice sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to know the dependence of the energy $E$ of a given\n",
    "microstate, according to the configuration of spins. The total energy in\n",
    "the presence of a uniform magnetic field is given by the “Ising model”:\n",
    "$$E=-J\\sum_{\\langle ij \\rangle}s_is_j-h\\sum_{i=1}^Ns_i,\n",
    "$$ where the first summation is over all nearest neighbor\n",
    "pairs and the second summation is over all the spins of the lattice. The\n",
    "“exchange constant” $J$ is a measure of the strength of the interaction\n",
    "between nearest neighbor spins. If $J>0$, the states with the spins\n",
    "aligned $\\uparrow \\uparrow$ and $\\downarrow \\downarrow$ are\n",
    "energetically favored, while for $J<0$ the configurations with the spins\n",
    "antiparallel $\\uparrow \\downarrow$ and $\\downarrow \\uparrow$ are the ones\n",
    "that are preferred. In the first case, we expect that the state with\n",
    "lower energy is “ferromagnetic”, while in the second case, we expect it\n",
    "to be “antiferromagnetic”. If we subject the system to a uniform\n",
    "magnetic field $h$ directed upward, the spins $\\uparrow$ and\n",
    "$\\downarrow$ possess and additional energy $-h$ and $+h$ respectively.\n",
    "Note that we chose the units of $h$ such that the magnetic moment per\n",
    "spin is unity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of obeying Newton’s laws, the dynamics of the Ising model\n",
    "corresponds to “spin flip” processes: a spin is chosen randomly, and the\n",
    "trial change corresponds to a flip of the spin $\\uparrow \\rightarrow\n",
    "\\downarrow$ or $\\downarrow \\rightarrow \\uparrow$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Boundary conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are interested in the properties of an infinite system, we have\n",
    "to consider the boundary conditions. The simplest case corresponds to\n",
    "“free boundary condition”, where the spins at sites $1$ and $N$ are open\n",
    "ends and have one interaction each. In general a better choice is\n",
    "periodic boundary conditions, where sites 1 and $N$ interact with each\n",
    "other closing a loop. In this situation, the chain has the topology of a\n",
    "ring, and all the spins have the same number of interactions. We also\n",
    "say that there is translational invariance, since the origin can be\n",
    "picked arbitrarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Physical quantities\n",
    "\n",
    "The net magnetic moment or \"magnetization\" $M$ is given by\n",
    "$$M=\\sum_{i=1}^N s_i.\n",
    "$$ Usually we are interested in the average\n",
    "$\\langle M \\rangle$ and the fluctuations\n",
    "$\\langle M^2 \\rangle - \\langle M \\rangle ^2$ as a function of the\n",
    "temperature of the system and the applied magnetic field. \n",
    "Notice that in the absence of a magnetic field, the value of $M$ should average zero.\n",
    "This is because the system is as likely to be found with all the spins pointing up or down.\n",
    "Therefore, one typically measures $m=\\sqrt{M^2}$, which is always a positive quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 11.2: One-dimensional Ising model \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Choose $N=20$, $T=1.0$, and all the spins initially pointing “up” as\n",
    "    the initial state. Calculate the energy after each step, and\n",
    "    estimate the number of steps for the system to reach equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Pick all the spins initially poiting randomly. Estimate the time\n",
    "    that takes for the system to reach equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Choose $N=20$ and equilibrate the system for 100 MC steps. Use at\n",
    "    least 200 MC steps to determine the mean energy $\\langle E \\rangle$\n",
    "    and magnetization $\\langle M \\rangle$ as a function of $T$ in the\n",
    "    range $T=0.5$ to $5.0$. Plot $\\langle E \\rangle$ as a function of\n",
    "    $T$ ans discuss its qualitative features. Compare your computed\n",
    "    results for the mean energy to the exact values:\n",
    "    $$\\langle E \\rangle = -N \\tanh{\\left(\\frac{J}{k_BT}\\right)}.$$ What\n",
    "    are yout results for $\\langle M \\rangle$? Do they depend on the\n",
    "    initial configuration?\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Is the acceptance ratio and increasing or decreasing function of\n",
    "    $T$? Does the Metropolis algorithm become more or less efficient at\n",
    "    low temperatures?\n",
