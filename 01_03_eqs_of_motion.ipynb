    "Equations of motion (2nd order ODEs)\n",
    "------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that the motion of an object is determined by Newton’s\n",
    "equations. In the one-dimensional case, we can define the instantaneous\n",
    "position $y(t)$, velocity $v(t)$ and acceleration $a(t)$ of an object\n",
    "using the language of differential calculus: $$v(t)=\\frac{dy}{dt},\n",
    "a(t)=\\frac{dv}{dt}.\n",
    "$$ The motion of the particle is defined by:\n",
    "$$\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}=\\frac{F(t)}{m}$$ This is a second order differential\n",
    "equation that can written as two first order differential equations:\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "\\frac{dv}{dt}&=&\\frac{F(t)}{m}; \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{dy}{dt}&=&v(t).\\end{eqnarray}$$ To solve it we can apply any of\n",
    "the methods described in the previous sections. If we pick Euler’s, we\n",
    "obtain: $$\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "v_{n+1}&=&v_n+\\frac{F(t)}{m}\\Delta t = v_n+a_n\\Delta t, \\\\\n",
    "y_{n+1}&=&y_n+v_n\\Delta t,\\end{eqnarray}$$ where $a_n=F(t)/m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 1.2: One dimensional motion\n",
    "Write a program to solve the 1d equations of motion for a falling\n",
    "object. Input values: $y_0=y(t=0)$; $v_0=v(t=0)$. Compare results with\n",
    "different $\\Delta t$ and the exact solution. Plot $y(t)$ and $v(t)$. Use\n",
    "$y_0=10m$; $v_0=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 1.3: Air resistance \n",
    "The form of the velocity-dependent force of the resistance of the air is\n",
    "given by $$F_d=kv$$ where $k$ is a parameter that depends on the\n",
    "properties of the medium and the shape of the object. Since $F$\n",
    "increases as $v$ increases, there is a limiting velocity at which\n",
    "$F_d=F_g=mg$ and the acceleration vanishes:\n",
    "$$kv_t=mg \\Rightarrow v_t=\\frac{mg}{k}$$ In terms of the terminal speed,\n",
    "the force $F_d$ can be rewritten as $$F_d=mg(\\frac{v}{v_t}).$$ Hence,\n",
    "the net force on a falling object is: $$F=mg(1-\\frac{v}{v_t})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Sometimes, the force $F_d$ can vary with the square of the velocity\n",
    "    $$F_d=k_2 v^2.$$ Derive the net force on a falling object using this\n",
    "    expression, in units of the terminal velocity $v_t$\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Compute the speed at which a pebble of mass $m=10^{-2}kg$ reaches\n",
    "    the ground if it’s dropped from rest ate $y_0=50m$. Compare this\n",
    "    speed to that of a freely falling object under the same conditions.\n",
    "    Assume that the drag force is proportional to $v^2$ and the terminal\n",
    "    speed is $v_t=30m/s$\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Supouse that an object is thrown vertically upward with initial\n",
    "    velocity $v_0$. If we neglect air resistance, we know that the\n",
    "    maximum height reached by the object is $v_0^2/2g$, and its velocity\n",
    "    upon return to the earth equals $v_0$, the time of ascent equals the\n",
    "    time of descent, and the total time in the air is $v_0/g$. Before\n",
    "    performing a numerical simulation, give a simple qualitative\n",
    "    analysis of the problem when it is affected by the resistance of\n",
    "    the air. Then, perform, the numerical calculation assuming\n",
    "    $F_d \\sim v^2$ with a terminal speed $v_t=30m/s$. Suggestions:\n",
    "    Choose $v>0$ when it’s pointing upward, and $v<0$ when it’s pointing\n",
    "    toward the earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 1.5: Gravitational force \n",
    "According to Newton’s law of gravitation, the action of the\n",
    "gravitational field of the earth on a particle is given by\n",
    "$$F=\\frac{GMm}{(R+y)^2}=\\frac{gm}{(1+y/R)^2},$$ where $y$ is measured\n",
    "from the earth’s surface, $R$ is the earth’s radius, $G$ is the\n",
    "gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the earth, and $g=GM/R^2$.\n",
    "There is not simple analytical solution for this problem. Modify your\n",
    "code to simulate the fall of a particle from an altitude $y_0$ with zero\n",
    "initial velocity, and compute its speed when it hits the ground.\n",
    "Determine the value of $y_0$ for which this impact velocity differs by\n",
    "one percent from its value under a constant acceleration $g=9.8m/s^2$.\n",
    "Take the radius of the earth to be $6.37\\times 10^6m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 1.6: Harmonic oscillator \n",
    "\n",
    "The two coupled first order equations\n",
    "$$\\frac{dy}{dt}=p; \\frac{dp}{dt}=-4\\pi ^2 y$$ define a harmonic\n",
    "oscillator with period $T=1$. Compute the position $y$ and momentum $p$\n",
    "as a function of time using a generalization of the previous code. Plot\n",
    "the results for $y_0=1$ and $p_0$=0. Investigate the accuracy with which\n",
    "the system returns to the initial state at integral values of $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two dimensional trajectories\n",
    "----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In a 2d trajectory, the direction of the drag force is opposite to the\n",
    "speed vector ${\\bf v}$. Newton’s equations of motion for $x$ and $y$\n",
    "components are written $$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "&& m\\frac{dv_x}{dt}=-F_dx; \\\\\n",
    "&& m\\frac{dv_y}{dt}=-mg-F_dy;\\end{aligned}$$ Using $F_d=kv^2$,\n",
    "$v_x=v\\cos{\\theta}$ and $v_y=v\\sin{\\theta}$, we find $$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "&& \\frac{dv_x}{dt}=-\\frac{k}{m}vv_v, \\\\ \n",
    "&& \\frac{dv_x}{dt}=-g-\\frac{k}{m}vv_v, \\end{aligned}$$ where\n",
    "$v^2=v_x^2+v_y^2$. Hence, we cannot calculate the vertical motion of the\n",
    "object without reference to the horizontal component.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 1.7: Trajectory of a shot \n",
    "\n",
    "Modify your code so that the 2d trajectory of an object can be computed,\n",
    "and graphs of $y$ as a function of $x$ can be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  As a check on your program, first neglect the effect of air\n",
    "    resistance so that you an compare to known results. Supouse that the\n",
    "    object is thrown and $t_0$ with an angle $\\theta _0$ with an initial\n",
    "    velocity $v_0=15$m/s. Vary $\\theta_0$ and show that the maximum\n",
    "    range occurs at $\\theta_0=45^{\\circ}$ Compare your result with the\n",
    "    exact value $v_0^2/g$\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Consider the effects of air resistance. Compute the maximum range,\n",
    "    and the corresponding angle using $k/m=0.1$, $v_0=30$m/s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stability\n",
    "---------\n",
    "\n",
    "A major consideration in integrating differential equations is the\n",
    "numerical stability of the algorithm used. Since we have replaced the\n",
    "differential equation by a difference equation, we know that our results\n",
    "will not be exact. Discrepancies will arise when using different step\n",
    "sizes, for instance. This is the “truncation error” and depends on the\n",
    "method employed. Other errors that do not originate in the method\n",
    "correspond to the roundoffs performed by the computer, since it does not\n",
    "work with real numbers, but with a finite number of digits determined by\n",
    "the hardware. These roundoff errors will accumulate and can become\n",
    "significant in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice we determine the accuracy of our solutions by reducing the\n",
    "value of the step until the solutions unchanged at the desired level of\n",
    "accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to accuracy, another important factor is the stability of\n",
    "the algorithm. For instance, it may occur that the numerical results are\n",
    "very good for short times, but diverge from the “true” solution for\n",
    "longer times. Such an algorithm is said to be “unstable” for the\n",
    "particular problem.\n",
